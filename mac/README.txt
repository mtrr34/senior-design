########### Active Plan ##########
# 
# Order and start the connection between the serial ports of the micro controller.
# Start testing the functionality of the bluetooth chip and test if we can actually
# connect from the microcontroller to the app (when it is built)
#
# Establish the connection between the GUI and the microcontroller and display something
# to a GUI that we are not going to be using but that one is similar.
